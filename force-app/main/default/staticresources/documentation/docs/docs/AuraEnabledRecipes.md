## Methods
### `getFieldValue()` → `string`

Demonstrates how to make a method available to Aura or LWC for read-only operations. This method returns a hard-coded string, but you could do a SOQL query, or other work.

#### Example
```java
System.debug(AuraEnabledRecipes.getFieldValue());
```

### `updateAccountName(Id accountId, String newValue)` → `boolean`

Updates a given account's name. Demonstrates how to receive information from an Aura or LWC component and use it to update an account. Note: This method contains a false-positive PMD warning. PMD is not aware of what CanTheUser is doing, and it falsely assumes that this code does not check for FSL / CRUD before querying. Additionally, this query contains 'WITH SECUIRTY_ENFORCED' a form of inline FLS/CRUD checking.

#### Parameters
|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|`accountId` |  Id of the account to update |
|`newValue` |   String of the name to set |

#### Example
```java
Id accountId = [SELECT Id FROM Account LIMIT 1].Id;
System.debug(AuraEnabledRecipes.updateAccountName(accountId, 'New value set by AuraEnabled method'));
```
